The number of 


Num. of PRBs Dl is set to 25 so peak Dl throughput is around 17 Mbps

The min video bitrate chosen in 0.4 Mbps so 17/0.4 = 42.5 UEs/eNodeB can be supported. 

If we are using 9 macro eNodeBs and 250 UEs then each eNodeB on an average will have 250/9 = 27.7 UEs connected. But depending on the distribution of UEs and mobility patterns it can be a lot more. 

I need to either reduce the min quality or I need to reduce number of UEs per basestation or I need to increase the bandwidth of the eNodeBs

I am going to try increasing the PRBs of macro eNodeB to 50.

The simulation setup seems to be around 967 X 967 meters
If every node should have the option of HD with 5 Mbps, then with 100 PRBs around 14 UEs can be supported per eNodeB.

with 9 macro eNodeBs as now with 100 PRBs we can support 9 X 14 = 126 UEs.
